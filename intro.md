A: You run your calculations on the data in this file.  Where do these numbers come from?

B: ''I extracted them from the main dataset using the shell commands.''

\only<2->{
A: So, which commands did you use to extract the data?

B: !I don't remeber!.

==== Do we have this problem at UMBC? ==== 

Qoutes heard from fellow students:

{\vskip .1in}

I thought I was done with my thesis, but my advisor wants me to re-do the same experiments on 4 more datasets.  I can't believe he is asking that.  That's like several months of work.  I'll never be done.


==== Do we have this problem at UMBC? ==== 

Qoutes heard from fellow students:

{\vskip .2in}

P: So here is the dataset, I copied everything to the public directory on our cluster.  Here are the genetic profile data and here is the file with the class labels. 

{\vskip .1in}

Q: So, how do you know which labels go with which profiles?

{\vskip .1in}

P: Ahh, sorry forgot the mapping file, !let me email it to you!.




==== Do we have this problem at UMBC? ==== 

Qoutes heard from fellow students:

{\vskip .2in}

P: Here is a great tool some former students wrote few years ago.  Why don't you run it again to get the fresh data for current research.

{\vskip .1in}

A: Sure, how hard could this be.

{\vskip .1in}

A: Ooops,  it !doesn't compile!.  The server !can't initialize the databse!,  SQL scripts are !failing!.

B: I don't think we can get it running any time soon.


==== Modern quote ====

In my own experience, error is ubiquitous in scientific computing, and one needs to work very diligently and energetically to eliminate it. One needs a very clear idea of what has been done in order to know where to look for likely sources of error. I often cannot really be sure what a student or colleague has done from his/her own presentation, and in fact often his/her description does not agree with my own understanding of what has been done, once I look carefully at the scripts. Actually, I find that researchers quite generally forget what they have done and misrepresent their computations.
