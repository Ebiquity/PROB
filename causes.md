==== Causes of non-reproducibility ====

* <1-> Computations are complex $ \rightarrow $ long running times.
* <2-> Datasets are large $ \rightarrow $ long running times.
* <3-> Humans have limited attention span.
* <4-> Long running times, limited attention span $ \rightarrow $ researcher lost track of context.


==== Causes of non-reproducibility ====

# <1-> Errors.
#* <2-> Software
#* <3-> Input parameters
#* <4-> Data
#* <5-> Environmental (hardware, 3rd party bugs) 
# <6-> When errors are detected and fixed. Things need to re-run.
# <7-> Errors $ \rightarrow $ computations have to be run multiple times.
# <8-> Last result is not always the best and correct


==== Causes of non-reproducibility ====

* Loss of context
* Repeated multiple runs 
* Need to keep intermediate results

==== Causes of non-reproducibility ====

* Interactive systems
** <2-> R
** <3-> Mathematica
** <4-> Matlab
** <5-> IPythonNotebook
* <6-> Powerful, but where do you keep intermediate results
