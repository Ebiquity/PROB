Lab notebooks

* <1-> Hard to remember to keep good records
* <2-> Not directly connected to the computation
* <3-> Old school

Can we just use their tools?

Can we just use their tools? !Not quite!

* <1-> Made for Code
* <2-> Code is not data
** <3-> Changes somewhat linearly
** <4-> Small / relatively small

* <3-> ITIL
* <4-> Testable infrastructure
* <5-> Continous delivery


==== IT Operations ====

Can we just use their tools?

* Somewhat new.
* Not so mature
* !Very different domain!

=! Big data community needs their own toolset !=
